# Tauri Plugin Python

**This is a Work in Progress and should probably not be used currently.**

Plugin to use [Python](https://www.python.org/) code from [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) applications.

It uses [RustPython](https://rustpython.github.io/), a open-source Python 3 interpreter written in Rust.

> ⚠️ Not compatible with Rust versions `> 1.75.0`.
>
> To use the most recent Rust versions, see branch `rustpython-next`, which uses an unreleased version of RustPython.
